Little Niles, every little boy in one, and so much fun
Little Niles, half a man and half a child and when he smiles
Like all children everywhere, he's living truth,
For truth is part of youth, and when you feel contentment
Surround you, you know he’s around you

Little Niles, warms your heart and cheers your day in every way
Little Niles, he’s forever on the go and never slow
When you hold him close to you, you realize there’s heaven in his eyes
You can’t imagine your life without him, you’re so wild about him
